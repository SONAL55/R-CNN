THE STATE OF ART GESTURE RECOGISATION TECHNOLOGY
I was trying to make a project on a new and quite innovative idea which is dynamic hand recognition Using Intelâ€™s image processing library.In this project, I am also using an R- CNN method for hand gesture recognition. 
Then, I am going to divide the whole system into three stages namely: Detection and tracking, feature extraction and training and recognition.
